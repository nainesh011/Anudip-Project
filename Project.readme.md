## Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing different OTT (Over-The-Top) video streaming services using Power BI. The dashboard provides an interactive and visual overview of streaming platforms, helping users understand service details, audience demographics, revenue patterns, and market trends. The project is designed in a clean, user-friendly way using buttons and bookmarks instead of traditional slicers or tables.
